## Subconcept Analysis

### integers (7 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~36 | None |

Good coverage of floor division, modulo, exponentiation with dynamic exercises.

### floats (4 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~36 | None |

Good round(), abs(), and division exercises with skin vars.

### booleans (4 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~36 | None |

Good AND/OR/NOT coverage with skin vars.

### conversion (6 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~36 | None |

Good int/str/bool conversion with dynamic exercises.

### truthiness (8 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~37 | None |

Excellent Python-specific truthiness coverage.

Key exercises:
- `truthiness-if-fill`: Pythonic empty-check pattern
- `truthiness-predict-dynamic`: Uses truthiness generator
- `truthiness-write-if`: Teaches idiomatic patterns

### comparisons (5 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~36 | None |

Good coverage of chained comparisons and membership.

### identity (8 exercises)
| Avg Score | Issues |
|-----------|--------|
| ~37 | None |

Excellent coverage of `is` vs `==` with edge cases.

Key exercises:
- `identity-is-none`: Core Pythonic pattern
- `identity-vs-equality`: Important distinction
- `identity-trap-predict`: Error-first learning
- `identity-predict-small-ints`: Edge case awareness
