# Exercise Grading Rubric

Use this rubric when reviewing exercise quality. **8 dimensions** (1-5 scale) plus a prerequisite gate.

---

## Prerequisite: Code Correctness Gate

Before scoring, verify the expected_answer actually solves the prompt correctly.

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **PASS** | Expected answer is logically complete and correct → proceed with rubric |
| **FAIL** | Expected answer is broken, incomplete, or wrong → fix before scoring |

*Example failure: A loop that breaks without capturing the result, or a prompt asking to "return" but no function context.*

---

## 1. Transfer Value (Tr)

*Does it matter outside this app?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Core skill used daily in production code |
| 4 | Common pattern, good muscle memory to have |
| 3 | Useful but situational |
| 2 | Edge case knowledge, rarely needed |
| 1 | Platform-specific or artificial constraint |

## 2. Cognitive Load Match (Cg)

*Level vs actual difficulty*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Level perfectly matches cognitive demand |
| 4 | Slightly over/under for level, acceptable |
| 3 | Noticeable mismatch but defensible |
| 2 | Wrong level - confuses progression |
| 1 | Grossly misplaced (intro feels like edge) |

## 3. Decision Depth (Dd)

*Choice vs recall*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Multiple valid approaches, learner must think |
| 4 | One clear best approach, but reasoning required |
| 3 | Pattern application with minor decisions |
| 2 | Direct recall with small variation |
| 1 | Pure token recall (fill-in single character) |

**Target Dd by Level** (these are *correct* scores, not deficiencies):

| Level | Target Dd | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Intro | 1-2 | Pattern recognition, not problem-solving |
| Practice | 3-4 | Apply with minor decisions |
| Edge | 4-5 | Multiple valid approaches |
| Integrated | 5 | Requires synthesis and choice |

## 4. Narrative Versatility (Nv)

*Skin system compatibility*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Universal AND actively uses skin variables for data/context |
| 4 | Adapts to most domains, uses some skin variables |
| 3 | Works in several domains but uses hardcoded data |
| 2 | Narrow - only fits 1-2 specific narratives |
| 1 | Contrived - feels artificial in any story |

*Key: An exercise can theoretically fit any domain (old Nv=5) but score Nv=3 if it has hardcoded data like `{"apple": 1.50}` instead of using skin vars.*

## 5. Answer Determinism (Ad)

*Is the correct answer unambiguous?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Single canonical form (fill-in token, exact output) |
| 4 | Few valid forms, all structurally similar |
| 3 | Multiple valid approaches exist |
| 2 | Many reasonable interpretations of "correct" |
| 1 | Highly subjective or open-ended |

## 6. Coverage Completeness (Cc)

*Are valid variations captured?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | All reasonable alternatives in accepted_solutions |
| 4 | Most alternatives covered, minor gaps |
| 3 | Common alternatives covered, some missing |
| 2 | Significant valid solutions not accepted |
| 1 | High false-negative risk (correct answers rejected) |

*Note: For fill-in/predict with Ad=5, Cc is effectively N/A (score 5). The Ad/Cc split matters most for write exercises.*

## 7. Idiom Quality (Id)

*Teaching good habits?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Teaches Pythonic best practice explicitly |
| 4 | Standard approach, no bad habits |
| 3 | Neutral - neither good nor bad pattern |
| 2 | Could reinforce brittle template thinking |
| 1 | Actively teaches anti-pattern |

## 8. Prompt Clarity (Pc)

*Is the question well-written?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Crystal clear, single interpretation, complete spec |
| 4 | Clear with minor verbosity or ambiguity |
| 3 | Understandable but could confuse some learners |
| 2 | Ambiguous, missing output format, or overly wordy |
| 1 | Confusing, misleading, or contradicts expected answer |

**Pc Checklist:**
- [ ] Single interpretation?
- [ ] Output format specified? (print vs return vs assign)
- [ ] Actionable hints?
- [ ] No unexplained jargon?
- [ ] Template vars used appropriately? (never as code identifiers)

## Scoring Thresholds (out of 40)

- **35-40**: Excellent - publish as-is
- **28-34**: Good - minor polish needed
- **20-27**: Acceptable - review before publishing
- **<20**: Needs rework
