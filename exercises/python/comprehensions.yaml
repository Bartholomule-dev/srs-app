      Write a generator function `evens(n)` that yields even numbers from 2 up to n (inclusive if n is even).

      evens(6) should yield 2, 4, 6.

          for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):
              yield i

            while i <= n:
                yield i
                i += 2
    hints:
      - Use range with step of 2
      - Start from 2 (first even positive integer)
      - yield each even number

    hints:
      - Generators are lazy - they don't run until iterated
      - next() runs until the first yield
      - Creating the generator doesn't execute the function body

      Write a generator function `fibonacci()` that yields the infinite Fibonacci sequence.

      The first yields should be: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
